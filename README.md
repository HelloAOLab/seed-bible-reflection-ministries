# 📖 Seed Bible

The source code behind the Seed Bible.

## Developing

Follow the given steps to get started developing the Seed Bible:

1. First, make sure you have the following programs installed:
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
     - Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you are on MacOS/Linux/WSL.
     - Install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) if you are on Windows.
     - Next, install the latest Node version:
       - `nvm install latest`
       - `nvm use latest`
   - The [`casualos` CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/casualos)
     - `npm install -g casualos`
   - [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
     - v10.x is required
     - You can install PNPM by using corepack:
       - `corepack use pnpm@latest-10`
2. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone git@github.com:HelloAOLab/seed-bible.git`
3. Install dependencies
   - `pnpm install`
   - `pnpm puppeteer browsers install chrome` - (Optional) Install Chrome for developing directly from the repo.
4. Open the repository with your favorite editor
5. Run the Seed bible package in Chrome
   - `pnpm dev`
   - Each run gives you a clean inst static to work in with the local seed bible.

### Scripts

There are several utility scripts:

- `pnpm dev` - Runs the SeedBible in development mode.
  - It will open Chrome in a clean inst from the state in the repository.
  - It also opens a REPL that has a couple helper scripts:
    - `.reload` - Reloads and resets the page to match what is in the local file system. Useful if you've made changes in VSCode and want to quickly update chrome to them.
    - `.system` - Opens the system portal.
    - `.chat [message]` - Sends the given message via the `@onChat` shout, just like the chat bar.
    - `.download` - Sends the `.download` chat message to download the AUX file.
  - The REPL also has a couple helper functions:
    - `run(script)` - Executes the given AUX Script.
    - `shout(name, arg?)` - Runs the given shout with the given argument.
- `pnpm check:ts` - Runs the TypeScript checker.
- `pnpm lint` - Runs linting.
- `pnpm test` - Runs tests.
- `pnpm test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode.
- `pnpm package` - Builds all of the packages and extensions into `.aux` files in the `dist` folder.

#### How to start the dev server

- `pnpm dev`

#### How to download the core app to the repository

1. Use the `pattern` CLI:
   - `pnpm pattern unpack SeedBible`

## Releasing

Production is deployed by merging `develop` into `main`: `cd.yml` builds and ships the merged commit to [seedbible.org](https://seedbible.org). Releasing adds a git tag, a GitHub Release, and a dated CHANGELOG entry on top of that deploy.

Day to day, add notes to the `## TBD` section at the top of [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) as you land changes (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed).

When you're ready to cut a release, run the prepare step **on `develop`**:

```bash
pnpm release:prepare minor    # or: patch | major | an explicit version like 1.4.0
```

This does three things in one commit's worth of edits:

- bumps the `version` in `packages/seed-bible/package.json` (the version baked into the build),
- rewrites the CHANGELOG's `## TBD` heading to `## v<version> — <YYYY-MM-DD>`, and
- inserts a fresh, empty `## TBD` above it so `develop` is ready for the next cycle.

Review the diff, commit on `develop`, and open a PR. Then merge `develop` → `main` as usual. That push runs `cd.yml`, which deploys the merged commit to [seedbible.org](https://seedbible.org). Only once that deploy **succeeds** does [`release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml) run — it's triggered by `cd.yml` finishing, not by the push itself, specifically so a release is never tagged or announced before it's actually live. It reads the version, tags the deployed commit `v<version>`, and publishes a GitHub Release whose notes are that version's CHANGELOG section. It is idempotent — a deploy that didn't bump the version (e.g. a hotfix) still ships but creates no release. If the version has no matching stamped CHANGELOG section (e.g. `release:prepare` was skipped before merging), the workflow logs a warning and skips the release instead of failing — the deploy still goes through cleanly.

The same workflow reposts the release notes to the Discord #announcements channel with a link to [seedbible.org](https://seedbible.org). This requires a repo secret `DISCORD_ANNOUNCE_WEBHOOK` (a Discord channel webhook URL: Channel → Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → Copy Webhook URL). If the secret is unset the announcement step simply no-ops, and a Discord failure never fails the release. Pre-releases (e.g. `1.2.0-rc.1`) are not announced.
