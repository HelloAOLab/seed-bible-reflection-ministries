/**
 * Seed Bible service worker.
 *
 * Built with vite-plugin-pwa's `injectManifest` strategy: this file is the
 * actual source, and the build replaces `self.__WB_MANIFEST` with the list of
 * precached (core) assets. See the `VitePWA(...)` block in `vite.config.ts`.
 *
 * The deployment shape this has to cope with (see the header comments in
 * `vite.config.ts` and `server/index.ts`):
 *
 *  - The page HTML is server-rendered per request. It is never a static file,
 *    so it can only ever be *runtime* cached, never precached.
 *  - Hashed chunks are NOT served from the site root. Every build publishes its
 *    own copy under `<assetRoot>branches/<branch>/<buildId>/assets/...`, so the
 *    precache manifest is rewritten at build time to those absolute URLs.
 *  - Only the root (`main`) build ships a service worker, but its scope is `/`,
 *    which also covers branch preview deployments mounted at `/b/<branch>/...`.
 *    Those are a *different* build with different assets, so this worker stays
 *    out of their way entirely.
 *
 * Caching strategy, in short:
 *
 *  | What                                   | Strategy                        |
 *  |----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
 *  | Core assets (entry JS, vendor, CSS, …) | Precache (install time)         |
 *  | Page HTML (any non-`/b/` navigation)   | StaleWhileRevalidate, one shared shell entry |
 *  | Other assets of *this* build           | CacheFirst                      |
 *  | Google Fonts / Fontshare stylesheets   | StaleWhileRevalidate            |
 *  | Google Fonts / Fontshare font files    | CacheFirst                      |
 *  | Anything else (other branches, APIs)   | Not handled — straight to net   |

// rewritten there to absolute asset-host URLs. Everything else the app loads
// lazily — extra language bundles, extension chunks — is left to the runtime

/**
 * All navigations share a single cached HTML entry (`APP_SHELL_URL`), not one
 * per path — see `appShellCacheKeyPlugin` above. The goal changed from "serve
 * the exact page requested" to "load instantly, without touching the network,
 * once *anything* is cached": this worker's main audience is returning
 * visitors on slow or unreliable connections, some of whom already have an
 * entire translation downloaded locally and don't need the HTML request at
 * all to keep reading.
 *
 * The cost: the client calls Preact's `hydrate()` when the served HTML
 * happens to match the requested path exactly, and `render()` otherwise (see
 * `app/hydrationGate.ts`). With one shared shell, that match now only happens
 * for requests this worker never intercepts in the first place — i.e. before
 * a service worker controls the page at all, when the browser always gets a
 * fresh, exact per-path SSR response — or by coincidence, when the cached
 * shell happens to be the same page being reopened. Every other navigation
 * gets the (mismatched) cached shell and falls back to `render()`, the same
 * already-tested path a cache miss took before. That's an accepted trade-off
 * here: instant, network-free loads vs. a brief client-side re-render on most
 * navigations.
 *
 * `StaleWhileRevalidate` is what keeps the shell current over time: every use
 * serves the cached copy immediately, then fetches the real path in the
 * background and overwrites the one shared entry with it, so the *next* load
 * — of any path — reflects whatever just shipped.

 * Fetches the shell once while installing, so the app survives being closed

 *
 * Without this there is a gap: the page that registers the worker isn't yet
 * controlled by it, so its HTML never passes through the route below. The
 * precache would be full but the shell cache empty, and an offline launch would
 * still land on the browser's "no connection" page until the user had visited
 * a second time.
 *
 * Returns whether the shell was actually refreshed. Never throws — this is
 * called from an install handler, where a rejected `waitUntil` promise fails
 * the install outright, and a failed warm here is meant to be recoverable
 * (see the `install` listener below), not fatal.
 *
 * Warms from the URL of the page that's actually registering this worker
 * (falling back to `/` if that can't be determined), since that's the only
 * real content available to seed the shell with — but stores it under the
 * shared `APP_SHELL_URL` key like every other write to this cache, not under
